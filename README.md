## Images

Images for article should be upload to SitePoint's CDN, if you are an existing author, this will be a new process for you. I don't have access to your passwords, so visit [sitepoint.com/wp-login.php](https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-login.php) and click 'Lost your password?' to reset it, your username will be _FirstnameLastname_ or your email address.

Once logged in, open _Media -> Add New_ and upload your media. Sometimes the uploader gets stuck at the 'crunching' stage, your image will still be uploaded.

Find your image in the _Media -> Library_ tab, click it to get the url and use that url in your markdown files.
