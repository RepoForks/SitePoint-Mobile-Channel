#What's Up Doc... Can You Prescribe Me An App?!
You may think that the title of this article is just a joke. It is actually no joke at all! Yes, [mobile technology is changing healthcare](http://www.sitepoint.com/mobile-technology-changing-healthcare/), to the extent that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is hoping to introduce a new [kitemarking of apps](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102181407) scheme, where apps will be accredited with the NHS logo.
## What is kitemarking?
[kitemark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitemark) is a service quality certification mark owned and operated by the [British Standards Institution (BSI Group)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_Group). It is frequently used to identify products where safety is essential, such as smoke alarms and crash helmets.

When we see that NHS mentions kitemarking alongside with healthcare apps, this can give us a two-fold indication: *(i)* the important role mobile technology is playing in our lives; and *(ii)* that using a health app for monitoring someone's health should not be random, and has to be taken under some guidance.

## Huge number of apps
I don't want to mention the general apps here, which, as of [July 2014](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/), were 1.3 million Google Android apps, and 1.2 million apps in Apple's app store, but, the health related apps, which based on a 2013 [report](http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6009), were close to 100â€‰000 apps in both Android and iOS.

Those health apps are part of a larger amount of apps sitting there in the app stores, of which are many useful apps that we are using in a daily basis. When health apps come in between, you would just treat them as just a new app of those useful apps you are using.

Here comes the danger, especially that you are now using something that is touching you directly, touching your health and body. If you are using a to-do app for instance, and screwed things up at some time, and didn't work that to-do well, there would be no harm on you, it is just some organization stuff that can be dealt with as experience grows. But, when it comes to health, there are some mistakes that are considered life mistakes, where one mistake is sufficient to ruin your life.

Thus, kitemarking comes in handy to control such large number of health apps, and allows someone to distinguish between which is safe to use, from those that are not. NHS logo to the rescure!

NHS has it own [health apps library](http://apps.nhs.uk/), where apps are considered safe to use, and which doctors can prescribe to their patients. Did I mention prescribing apps to patients again?! So, let's see what we have to say about this in the next section.

## Doctors prescribe apps
[iMedicalApps](http://www.imedicalapps.com/) wanted to take this a bit [further](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2015/03/iprescribeapps-doctors-prescribe-health-apps/), and decided to launch [iPrescribeApps](http://iprescribeapps.com/), a platform which will enable physicians to prescribe the right app to the right patient.

iPrescribeApps is looking forward to be a reputable and unbiased resource for guiding physicians and patients when they want to use apps for health management, where physicians will be able to prescribe apps and devices to patients.

Once the patient is prescribed with an app or device, the patient will receive notifications and detailed instructions on how to use that prescribed app or device.


Thus, when a physician recommends an app or devicve to a patient, the patient will get an email from iPrescribeApps, where they will be directed (*i.e.* detailed instructional videos) on how to use the tool to improve his/her health.

The interesting part comes at the follow up visits, where patients will be able to share their health tracking information with their physician, allowing the physician to manage their health effectively.

It is important to note here that through this platfrom, the health apps and devices prescribed will be curated using *evidence based criteria* and *expert opinion* by the physicians of iMedicalApps.

## There is a point
In February, 2014, 250 physicians in the US were [surveyed](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102181407) about their opinion on prescribing apps to patients. 42% of those physicians mentioned that they would *not* prescribe apps to their patients. The reason was, according to Quantia Inc's website, is that there was "no regulatory oversight".

Do you think prescribing apps would be as promising as what it seems? Do you think it would be practical to prescribe apps to patients? Looking forward to your thoughts on that.
