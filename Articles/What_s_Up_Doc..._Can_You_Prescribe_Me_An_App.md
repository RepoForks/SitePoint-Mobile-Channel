#What's Up Doc... Can You Prescribe Me An App?!

The title of this article is actually no joke all! [Mobile technology is changing healthcare](http://www.sitepoint.com/mobile-technology-changing-healthcare/), to the extent that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is hoping to introduce a new [kitemarking of apps](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102181407) scheme, where apps will be accredited with the NHS logo.

## What is kitemarking?
[Kitemark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitemark) is a service quality certification mark owned and operated by the [British Standards Institution (BSI Group)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_Group). It is frequently used to identify products where safety is essential, such as smoke alarms and crash helmets.

When we see that NHS mentions kitemarking alongside with healthcare apps, this can give us a two-fold indication: *(i)* the important role mobile technology is playing in our lives; and *(ii)* that using a health app for monitoring someone's health should not be random, and has to be taken under some guidance.

## Huge number of apps
I don't want to mention the general apps here, which, as of [July 2014](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/), were 1.3 million Google Android apps, and 1.2 million apps in Apple's app store, but, the health related apps, which based on a 2013 [report](http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6009), were close to 100â€‰000 apps in both Android and iOS.


The risk with health apps is that they can have repercutions on the indivdual user's health and safety. If you are using a to-do app for instance, and you didn't stick too it, or make an error in your to do list, there would be no harm to you, just some stress in catching up with late or forgotten tasks, organizational stuff that can be dealt with. But, when it comes to health monitoring and treatment, the consequences may be far greater. 

Because of this, kitemarking is a means to provide quality control to the consumer drowning in the large number of health apps, allowing them to distinguish between apps which are created under the auspice of health professionals, diagnositicans and researchers which use medically tested tools and credible health information and those that could be considered more the work of a charlatan or being more generous, an enthusiastic well being couch.

The UK NHS now has its own [health apps library](http://apps.nhs.uk/), which features apps that re considered medically trustworthy and have been reviewed by health professionals. A health profession can review the list and then prescribe an appropriate app to their patient or an individual can choose an app to help their improve their own health and well being.

## Doctors prescribe apps
America's [iMedicalApps](http://www.imedicalapps.com/) wanted to take this a bit [further](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2015/03/iprescribeapps-doctors-prescribe-health-apps/), and decided to launch [iPrescribeApps](http://iprescribeapps.com/), a platform to enable physicians to prescribe the right app to the right patient.

iPrescribeApps is aiming to be a reputable and unbiased resource for guiding physicians and patients when they want to use apps for health management, where physicians will be able to prescribe apps and devices to patients. This is distinct from an individual accessing a list of apps and self selecting one for their own personal use, it comes recommending by one's personal physician. 

Once the patient is prescribed with an app or device, the patient will receive notifications via emails from IPrescribeApps with detailed instructions (such as instructional videos) on how to use their prescribed app to improve their health.The interesting part comes at the follow up visits, where patients will be able to share their health tracking information with their physician, allowing the physician to manage their health effectively. 

It is important to note here that through this platfrom, the health apps and devices prescribed will be curated using *evidence based criteria* and *expert opinion* by the physicians of iMedicalApps.

## There is a point
In February, 2014, 250 physicians in the US were [surveyed](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102181407) about their opinion on prescribing apps to patients. 42% of those physicians mentioned that they would *not* prescribe apps to their patients. The reason was, according to Quantia Inc's website, is that there was "no regulatory oversight".

Do you think prescribing apps would be as promising as what they seem? Do you think it would be practical to prescribe apps to patients? Looking forward to your thoughts on that.
